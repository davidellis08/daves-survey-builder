# David Ellis Test Engineer Assessment
Task 1 - Find and document bugs with detailed reproduction steps
* I have used the Issues tab to document bugs keeping all project work together in github [Issues tab](https://github.com/davidellis08/daves-survey-builder/issues)

Task 2 - Create a manual regression test pack
* High level gherkin e2e feature file can be found here: [ survey-creation-submission-review-delete-e2e.feature](manual-regression-task/gherkin/features/regression/survey-creation-submission-review-delete-e2e.feature)

* Manual test plan for execution (based on gherkin file) can be found here: [Manual Regression Test Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1050Ak4A60kmJyawbwDDofBSdm3QRGkmyIu8GwJdfB-k/edit?usp=sharing)

* On the wiki I have also created a brief test strategy and some questions for the project owner: [wiki](https://github.com/davidellis08/daves-survey-builder/wiki)
